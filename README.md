# Gasless Pipe

A decentralized identity management and transaction infrastructure enabling gasless interactions on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

Gasless Pipe provides a robust, secure identity registry and transaction infrastructure that allows users to interact with decentralized applications without paying gas fees. By leveraging meta-transactions and advanced identity verification, the platform simplifies blockchain interaction.

## Core Features

- Decentralized identity management
- Gasless transaction infrastructure
- Advanced reputation and verification system
- Meta-transaction support
- Flexible identity credential tracking
- Low-friction blockchain interaction

## Smart Contracts

### Identity Registry Contract
The core contract managing user identities and reputation.

Key functions:
- `create-profile`: Create new user identity
- `verify-identity`: Validate user credentials
- `update-reputation`: Modify user reputation
- `get-profile`: Retrieve identity information
- `get-user-tier`: Determine identity tier

### Meta-Transaction Handler
Manages gasless transactions and relayer interactions.

Key functions:
- `execute-meta-transaction`: Process gasless transactions
- `register-relayer`: Add transaction relayers
- `validate-meta-transaction`: Verify transaction integrity
- `charge-relayer-fee`: Compensate transaction relayers

## Getting Started

To interact with Gasless Pipe, you'll need:
1. A Stacks-compatible wallet
2. Basic understanding of meta-transactions
3. Relayer credentials (optional)

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Identity
```clarity
(contract-call? .identity-registry create-profile
    "username"
    "user-bio")
```

### Verifying Identity
```clarity
(contract-call? .identity-registry verify-identity
    tx-sender
    "verification-proof")
```

## Security Considerations

- Robust identity verification mechanisms
- Meta-transaction replay protection
- Flexible reputation tracking
- Decentralized relayer network
- Transparent credential management
